Okay we got time down now we have to put more work on displaying fallen and avenger below the names
We may want to switch the "Fallen" and "Avenger" names so they don't always appear on the left or right.

Time to tip the scales.

New IDEA:

Have the for loop go fast like usual and have names appear every three seconds.

But this time use a while loop and pop the names to appear every three secodns until there are no more names in each list!


Old idea:

We can't go through the names one by one in game functions. It may have to work just like the space invasion ship.

Each name may have to be a frame that updates. Maybe I can do that in a text class instead?
